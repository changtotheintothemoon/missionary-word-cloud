Let's Trust in Jesus
From the mountain high
To the valley low,
From the things we see
To the great unknown,
He is our true north,
He is our way home,
He is our guide
In this world that's so wild.
 
Let's trust in Jesus.
Let's trust in Jesus
Wherever he leads us.
Let's trust in Jesus.

When you feel alone
And you're powerless,
When you need some hope,
Just remember this:
He holds the seas,
He names the stars,
And he's always with you
Wherever you are, so

Let's trust in Jesus.
Let's trust in Jesus
Wherever he leads us.
Let's trust in Jesus.

O-oh, oh
O-oh, oh
O-oh, oh
O-oh, oh

Let's trust in Jesus.
Let's trust in Jesus
Wherever he leads us.
Let's trust in Jesus.

Did you know there's someone loving You?
He lives in me and other people too
Did you know He died on a cross?
And did you know His name is Jesus?
I want to thank You
For everything You've done
You love me and gave Your only Son
To die on a cross for my sin
To die on a cross for my sin
Did you know He rose from the dead?
He's risen up and He'll be back again
Did you know He's loving you today?
And did you know He's the only way?
I want to thank You
For everything You've done
You love me and gave Your only Son
To die on a cross for my sin
To die on a cross for my sin
I want to thank You
For everything You've done
You love me and gave Your only Son
I want to thank You
For everything You've done
You love me and gave Your only Son
To die on a cross for my sin
To die on a cross for my sin
To die on a cross for my sin

Grin again gang get gung ho about Jesus

Smile sweetly Sally so you send Satan sadly away

Buck up brother Bill because a bunch of bitter boys became a bunch of better boys beneath a big big smile

Grin again gang get gung ho about Jesus

My God is powerful
He stands invinsible
I will hold on to Him

I will hold on to Him
Through God I will overcome
He's the Rock that will never move
I will hold on to Him
I will hold on to Him

His power moves the earth and sky
Takes me to the highest heights
My God is powerful

His power will forgive and heal
Crushes darkness
Drives our fear
My God is powerful

His power will forgive and heal
Crushes darkness, drives our fear
My God is powerful
